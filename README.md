# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```



# TO RUN

- npx hardhat run scripts/run.js

- Every time you run a terminal command that starts with `npx hardhat` you are getting this hre object built on the fly using the `hardhat.config.js` specified in your code! This means you will never have to actually do some sort of import into your files like:
`const hardhat = require("hardhat")`


# To Deploy
- npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
